### Testing (Test-Driven Development Required)
- **ALWAYS use Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for this project
- Write tests BEFORE implementing functionality (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- Follow TDD workflow:
  1. **Red**: Write a failing test that describes the desired behavior
  2. **Green**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass
  3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests green
- **Comprehensive test coverage implemented**:
  - Widget tests for UI components (`test/widgets/`)
  - Unit tests for business logic and data models (`test/models/`, `test/services/`)
  - Integration tests for chat functionality
  - User data storage and templating services (`test/services/`)
- Use `flutter test` to run tests
- Test files mirror the `lib/` directory structure in `test/`
- Import main app code using `package:noexc/main.dart`
- **Current test status: 85 passing, 0 failing** (All timer disposal issues resolved!)
- Test coverage includes:
  - ChatMessage model serialization/deserialization with storeKey support (24/24 tests)
  - Choice model functionality and equality (3/3 tests)
  - ChatService conversation flow and message loading (9/9 tests)
  - Enhanced ChatService integration (9/9 tests)
  - UserDataService local storage operations (10/10 tests)
  - TextTemplatingService with fallback support (18/18 tests)

  - `UIConstants` - UI styling constants (spacing, animations, sizes)
  - `ChatConfig` - Chat functionality configuration
  - `ThemeConstants` - Theme and color constants
- **Widgets**: 
  - `ChatScreen` - Main orchestrator (reduced from 448 to 85 lines)
  - `ChatStateManager` - Centralized state management with ChangeNotifier
  - `MessageBubble` - Individual message display routing
  - `ChoiceButtons` - Choice selection UI component
  - `TextInputBubble` - Text input interface component
  - `ChatMessageList` - Message list management

- **Assets**: JSON file containing branching chat script with choices, text input prompts, and storage keys

### Chat Message Structure
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "text": "Hello, {user.name|Guest}! Welcome to the app!",
  "delay": 1000,
  "sender": "bot",
  "isChoice": false,
  "isTextInput": false,
  "storeKey": "user.name",
  "choices": [
    {"text": "Option 1", "nextMessageId": 10}
  ],
  "nextMessageId": 2
}
```
- `id`: Unique identifier for the message
- `text`: The message content to display (supports templating with `{key}` or `{key|fallback}` syntax)
- `delay`: Milliseconds to wait before showing this message
- `sender`: Either "bot" or "user" to determine message styling
- `isChoice`: Boolean indicating if this message presents choices to the user
- `isTextInput`: Boolean indicating if this message expects text input from user
- `storeKey`: Optional key to store user input or choice selection for future recall
- `choices`: Array of choice objects with text and next message ID
- `nextMessageId`: ID of the next message in the conversation flow

### Interactive Features
- **Choice Selection**: Users can tap buttons to select conversation paths
- **Text Input**: Users can type responses for personalization
- **Branching Conversations**: Different paths based on user choices
- **Message Flow Control**: Service manages conversation state and progression
- **User Response Handling**: Creates user messages and continues conversation flow
- **Data Persistence**: User inputs and choices are automatically stored locally
- **Text Templating**: Messages are personalized using stored user data
- **Fallback Values**: Professional messaging with `{key|fallback}` syntax prevents raw placeholders
- **User Variables Panel**: Sliding overlay accessible via person icon in AppBar showing all stored user data

### Getting Started
1. Ensure Flutter SDK is installed and configured
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Use `flutter test` to verify all tests pass (85/85 tests should pass)
4. Use `flutter run` to start the interactive chat application
5. Explore the chat interface with choice-based navigation, text input, and personalization
6. Test the user information recall by entering your name and seeing personalized messages
7. Access the User Variables Panel by tapping the person icon in the AppBar to view stored data
8. Begin development by following TDD principles and updating relevant models, services, or widgets
9. **New modular architecture**: Components are organized in `lib/widgets/chat_screen/` for easy maintenance

### User Information Recall System
The app now includes a comprehensive system for storing and recalling user information:

#### **Data Storage**
```dart
// Store user data
await userDataService.storeValue('user.name', 'Alice');
await userDataService.storeValue('user.preferences', ['dark_theme', 'notifications']);

// Retrieve stored data
final name = await userDataService.getValue<String>('user.name');
final hasData = await userDataService.hasValue('user.name');
```

#### **Text Templating**
```json
{
  "text": "Welcome back, {user.name|valued user}! Your theme is {user.theme|default}.",
  "storeKey": "user.visit_count"
}
```

**Template Syntax:**
- `{key}` - Use stored value or leave unchanged if not found
- `{key|fallback}` - Use stored value or fallback if not found

#### **Automatic Data Collection**
- Text input messages with `storeKey` automatically store user responses
- Choice messages with `storeKey` automatically store selected options
- Data persists across app sessions using shared_preferences

#### **Benefits**
- **Personalized Experience**: Messages adapt based on stored user data
- **Professional UX**: Fallback values prevent raw template placeholders
- **Local Privacy**: All data stored locally on device
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing chat scripts work unchanged

### User Variables Panel Feature
The app now includes a comprehensive User Variables Panel feature:

#### **Panel Access**
- Accessible via person icon in the ChatScreen AppBar
- Smooth sliding animation (300ms duration with easeInOut curve)
- Semi-transparent overlay for better UX
- Tap outside panel to close

#### **Data Display**
- Shows all stored user variables in clean key-value format
- Handles different data types (strings, lists, booleans, numbers)
- Empty state message when no data exists
- Loading indicator during data fetch
- Automatic data refresh when panel opens

#### **Technical Implementation**
- `UserVariablesPanel` widget with Material Design styling
- Uses existing `UserDataService.getAllData()` method
- Integrated into `ChatScreen` with proper state management
- Follows TDD principles with comprehensive test coverage
- Cross-platform compatible (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)

#### **Benefits**
- **Data Transparency**: Users can view all their stored information
- **Professional UX**: Smooth animations and consistent styling
- **Non-Intrusive**: Overlay design doesn't interrupt chat flow
- **Maintainable**: Clean architecture following existing app patterns
- **Extensible**: Ready for future enhancements (editing, export, etc.)
