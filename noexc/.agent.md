# Flutter Project Development Guide

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: noexc
- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Language**: Dart
- **SDK Version**: ^3.7.2
- **Type**: Cross-platform mobile/desktop/web application
- **Status**: New project (starter template)

## Project Structure

### Core Directories
- `lib/` - Main Dart source code
  - `main.dart` - Application entry point with counter demo app
- `test/` - Widget and unit tests
  - `widget_test.dart` - Basic widget tests for counter functionality
- `assets/` - Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)

### Platform-Specific Directories
- `android/` - Android-specific configuration and native code
- `ios/` - iOS-specific configuration and native code  
- `web/` - Web-specific configuration and assets
- `windows/` - Windows desktop configuration
- `linux/` - Linux desktop configuration
- `macos/` - macOS desktop configuration

### Configuration Files
- `pubspec.yaml` - Package dependencies and Flutter configuration
- `analysis_options.yaml` - Dart analyzer and linting rules
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns for Flutter projects

## Dependencies

### Main Dependencies
- `flutter` - Flutter SDK
- `cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8` - iOS-style icons

### Development Dependencies
- `flutter_test` - Testing framework
- `flutter_lints: ^5.0.0` - Recommended linting rules

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Linting
- Uses `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` for recommended linting rules
- Follow Flutter/Dart naming conventions
- Use `super.key` for widget constructors
- Prefer `const` constructors where possible

### Testing (Test-Driven Development Required)
- **ALWAYS use Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for this project
- Write tests BEFORE implementing functionality (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- Follow TDD workflow:
  1. **Red**: Write a failing test that describes the desired behavior
  2. **Green**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass
  3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests green
- Write widget tests for UI components
- Write unit tests for business logic and data models
- Use `flutter test` to run tests
- Test files should be in the `test/` directory
- Import main app code using `package:noexc/main.dart`
- Aim for high test coverage (minimum 80%)
- Never commit code without corresponding tests

### Project Commands
- `flutter run` - Run the application
- `flutter test` - Run all tests
- `flutter analyze` - Run static analysis
- `flutter pub get` - Install dependencies
- `flutter pub upgrade` - Update dependencies
- `flutter clean` - Clean build artifacts

### File Organization
- Keep main application logic in `lib/`
- Use descriptive file and class names
- Follow Flutter's widget composition patterns
- Separate concerns into different files as the project grows

### Platform Support
This project is configured for:
- ✅ Android
- ✅ iOS  
- ✅ Web
- ✅ Windows
- ✅ Linux
- ✅ macOS

### Best Practices
- Use `setState()` for local state management
- Implement proper widget lifecycle methods
- Use Material Design components for consistent UI
- Follow Flutter's reactive programming model
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Use hot reload for faster development iteration

### Documentation Maintenance
- **ALWAYS update this .agent.md file after significant changes**
- Update documentation when:
  - Adding new dependencies or packages
  - Changing project structure or architecture
  - Implementing new development patterns or practices
  - Adding new build scripts or development tools
  - Modifying testing strategies or requirements
  - Adding new platform support or configurations
  - Establishing new coding conventions or guidelines
- Keep the documentation current and accurate for new team members
- Document any project-specific patterns, utilities, or conventions
- Include examples and rationale for important decisions

### Current Application
The starter app includes:
- Basic counter functionality
- Material Design theming with purple color scheme
- Floating action button for incrementing counter
- Proper state management with StatefulWidget
- Basic app bar and scaffold structure

### Getting Started
1. Ensure Flutter SDK is installed and configured
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Use `flutter run` to start the application
4. Use `flutter test` to verify tests pass
5. Begin development by modifying `lib/main.dart`

### Notes
- This is a private package (`publish_to: 'none'`)
- Uses Material Design by default
- Hot reload is supported for faster development
- All platforms are pre-configured and ready for development
