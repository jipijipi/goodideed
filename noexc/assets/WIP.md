1) Discuss/plan on how to make the incoming message bubbles slide in from the bottom and "push" the rest of the conversation up. Discuss the simplest most straightforward implementation possible. The existing chat should scroll up as one and not retrigger individual animations for every incoming message. Do not code yet.

2) Plan on implementing a typing indicator for bot messages. the indicator should be on the bubble that would eventually display the message. Take the message's delay into consideration. Make the implementation as simple and straightforward as possible.

3) How would you make the bot messages accept rich text? This only concerns bot and system messages, not user inputs. Make the implementation as simple and straightforward as possible.

4) Implement a new node that would display an image. Make the implementation as simple and straightforward as possible.
