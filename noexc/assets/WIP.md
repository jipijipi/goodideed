In the react flow authoring tool, I would like to be able to edit the variant files : 

1) In a panel that would appear on message or edge selection
2) The panel would have an editable text area with the content of the related file if available
3) On save, the file content would be replaced by the content of the text area

Discuss this possibility and suggest how to best do this, do not code yet
