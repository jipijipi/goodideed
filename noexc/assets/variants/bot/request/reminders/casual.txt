How insistent do you need me to be in reminding you?
Well now, shall I nudge you gently or give you the full theatrical treatment?
Tell me, dear mortal, how persistent must your genie be with the reminders?
So, what level of pestering are we aiming for here?
How much of a delightful nuisance should I become about your reminders?
Care to specify the intensity of my motivational harassment?
Right then, how aggressively charming should my reminders be?
What degree of sardonic encouragement can your fragile ego handle?
