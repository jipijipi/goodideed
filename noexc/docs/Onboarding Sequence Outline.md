# Onboarding Sequence Outline

---

## 1. First Launch – Hook
- 🎭 **Antagonist Introduction**
  - Animated entrance (jester/robot pops onto screen, overly dramatic).
  - Quip: *“Oh, look who decided to show up. Don’t worry, I’m not impressed… yet.”*  
- Goal: Establish character voice immediately and set humorous, teasing tone.

---

## 2. App Premise – Why You’re Here
- Short explanation (delivered by antagonist):  
  - *“You want to build habits? Cute. I’m here to make sure you don’t slack off.”*  
- Visual metaphor (Rive animation):  
  - Habits represented as seeds → tree that can wither or grow.  
- Goal: Explain app in **one playful metaphor**.

---

## 3. Core Feature Showcase
- **Streaks** → Visualized as glowing dots or growing vines.  
- **Reminders** → Antagonist makes a sarcastic joke about “nagging.”  
- **Reverse Motivation** → Character dares the user to try.  
- Each feature is shown quickly with a tiny interactive demo.  
- Goal: Introduce app’s core mechanics while keeping humor alive.

---

## 4. Personalization Setup
- Ask user for:
  - Name → Antagonist mocks it (*“Really? That’s what you’re going with?”*).  
  - Top habit(s) → Antagonist reacts dramatically depending on choice.  
- Quick Rive animations respond (e.g., exaggerated excitement for “exercise,” yawning for “reading”).  
- Goal: Make setup **fun, not dry**.

---

## 5. Stakes & Challenge Framing
- Antagonist explains the “deal”:
  - *“Each day you show up, I lose. Each day you fail, I win. Care to play?”*  
- Show animated scale/balance of **User Progress vs Antagonist Glee**.  
- Goal: Turn tracking into a **personal battle with the antagonist**.

---

## 6. Tutorial Interaction
- Simple walk-through:
  - Add your **first habit** (quick action).  
  - Set your **reminder time**.  
- Antagonist guides sarcastically:
  - *“Don’t worry, I’ll remind you… not that you’ll listen.”*  
- Goal: Get user to complete **1 action inside the app** right away.

---

## 7. First Reward
- Celebrate with a **mock overreaction**:
  - Animation: Antagonist claps ironically, maybe pretends to faint.  
  - Quip: *“Wow, you tapped a button. Truly legendary.”*  
- Goal: End onboarding with laughter + first taste of antagonist humor.

---

## 8. Exit & Daily Loop Hook
- Antagonist delivers final challenge:
  - *“Fine, you’ve set it up. Let’s see if you survive tomorrow.”*  
- Visual exit → character disappears dramatically.
