# Content Editor Implementation Test

## Implementation Summary

The content editor has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **ContentEditorPanel Component**: 
   - Displays when a node or edge with contentKey is selected
   - Shows content preview and inline editing
   - Positioned as overlay panel (top-right)

2. **State Management**:
   - Added `contentVariants` state to store all content variants
   - Integrated with React Flow selection system
   - Real-time updates when content is modified

3. **Export Integration**:
   - Extended export functionality to include content variant files
   - Exports .txt files with semantic naming (e.g., `bot_request_excuse_direct.txt`)
   - Updates export button to show content count
   - Sequential file downloads with proper timing

4. **User Experience**:
   - Panel shows/hides based on selection
   - Preview mode shows existing variants
   - Edit mode with textarea for line-by-line editing
   - File path display for clarity
   - Variant count indicators

### üéØ How to Test

1. **Start the development server**: 
   ```bash
   cd noexc-authoring-tool
   PORT=3003 npm start
   ```

2. **Test Content Editing**:
   - Create or select a node with a contentKey field
   - ContentEditorPanel should appear on the right
   - Click "‚úèÔ∏è Edit Variants" to modify content
   - Enter variants (one per line) and save
   - Panel should update to show the new variants

3. **Test Export**:
   - Add some content variants to nodes/edges
   - Click "üöÄ Export Flutter" button
   - Should download both .json sequence files AND .txt content files
   - Export button should show "(+N content)" when variants exist

### üìÇ Files Created/Modified

- **New**: `/components/ContentEditorPanel.tsx` - Main content editing component
- **Modified**: `/App.tsx` - Added state management, export functionality, and panel integration

### üöÄ Export Behavior

When exporting:
- **Sequences**: Continue to export as `.json` files
- **Content Variants**: Export as `.txt` files with semantic naming
- **File Naming**: `bot.request.excuse.direct` ‚Üí `bot_request_excuse_direct.txt`
- **Content Format**: One variant per line (matching Flutter expectation)
- **Timing**: Sequential downloads with 500ms delays to prevent browser throttling

### ‚ú® User Workflow

1. **Design Flow**: Create conversation flow in React Flow
2. **Add Content**: Select nodes/edges and add content variants
3. **Export All**: Single button exports everything (sequences + content)
4. **Use in Flutter**: Copy exported files to Flutter project

The implementation provides a simple, integrated workflow for content management without requiring filesystem access or external dependencies.
