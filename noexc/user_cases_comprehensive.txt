Status Transitions
------------------
19. Pending to completed - User successfully completing their task
20. Pending to started - User indicating they've begun their task
21. Started to completed - User finishing a task they had started
22. Task failure reporting - User admitting they failed to complete task


MODERATE EDGE CASES (Less Common Scenarios)
===========================================

Deadline and Timing Issues
---------------------------
23. Past deadline visit - User opening app after their configured deadline
24. Overdue task - Task automatically marked as overdue by system
25. Grace period scenarios - User checking in day after missing deadline
26. Late night visits - User opening app very late (night time period)
27. Multiple visits after deadline - User returning multiple times past deadline

Streak and Performance Tracking
--------------------------------
28. High streak user - User with 20+ day completion streak
29. Struggling user - User with multiple failures, on notice status
30. Streak reset - User breaking a long streak
31. Notice period - User who has been put "on notice" for poor performance
32. Recovery attempt - User trying to recover from failed status

Previous Day Handling
---------------------
33. Previous day completion - User completing yesterday's task late
34. Previous day grace period - System checking if previous day grace expired
35. Multi-day catch-up - User trying to report on multiple previous days
36. Previous task archival - System archiving old task data


UNCOMMON EDGE CASES (Situational)
=================================

Data and Configuration Issues
-----------------------------
37. Missing task configuration - User has no task set but is onboarded
38. Corrupted user data - Partial or invalid data in storage
39. Missing deadline - No deadline time configured
40. Invalid active days - Empty or malformed active days configuration
41. Theme switching - User toggling between light/dark mode
42. Settings reset - User resetting all their preferences

Sequence Navigation Issues
--------------------------
43. Cross-sequence navigation - User navigating between different conversation sequences
44. Interrupted conversation - User closing app mid-conversation
45. Deep conversation paths - User going through multiple choice branches
46. Sequence loading failure - JSON sequence file fails to load
47. Missing sequence reference - Sequence references non-existent sequence

Input and Interaction Edge Cases
---------------------------------
48. Empty text input - User submitting blank responses
49. Extremely long task names - User entering very long task descriptions
50. Special character input - User using emoji, symbols, or unicode in inputs
51. Rapid-fire interactions - User clicking buttons very quickly
52. Choice selection edge cases - User selecting invalid or boundary choices


RARE EDGE CASES (Technical/Extreme)
===================================

System and Performance Issues
------------------------------
53. App crash recovery - Recovering state after unexpected app termination
54. Storage permission issues - SharedPreferences access denied or failing
55. Memory constraints - App running under low memory conditions
56. Network connectivity issues - If app ever needs network access
57. Background/foreground transitions - App state changes during OS switching

Time and Date Edge Cases
-------------------------
58. Timezone changes - User traveling across timezones
59. Daylight saving transitions - Time changes affecting deadlines
60. System clock manipulation - User changing device time manually
61. Leap year handling - Date calculations during leap years
62. Year boundary crossing - App usage spanning New Year's Eve
63. Extreme future dates - Date calculations far in the future

Data Corruption and Recovery
-----------------------------
64. Partial data corruption - Some storage keys corrupted, others intact
65. Storage quota exceeded - Device storage full, can't save data
66. Concurrent access issues - Multiple app instances somehow running
67. JSON parsing failures - Malformed sequence files
68. Type casting errors - Data stored in wrong format (int vs string)

Extreme Usage Patterns
-----------------------
69. Years of continuous usage - User with 1000+ total visits
70. Extreme streak scenarios - 365+ day streaks or massive failures
71. Rapid onboarding/reset cycles - User constantly resetting and re-onboarding
72. Debug panel abuse - User manipulating variables in unintended ways
73. Sequence export/import edge cases - Using authoring tool with corrupt data


TECHNICAL EDGE CASES (Development/Testing)
==========================================

Development and Debug Scenarios
--------------------------------
74. Debug scenario switching - Using the 8 predefined debug scenarios
75. Variable manipulation - Direct editing of user variables via debug panel
76. Sequence hot-swapping - Changing sequences mid-conversation
77. Logger service edge cases - Extreme logging scenarios, log rotation
78. Service locator failures - Core services failing to initialize
79. Validation system edge cases - Asset validation failures

Integration and Platform Issues
-------------------------------
80. Flutter engine issues - Framework-level problems
81. Platform-specific behaviors - iOS vs Android vs Web differences
82. Hot reload scenarios - Development-time state preservation
83. Build configuration issues - Release vs debug behavior differences
84. Asset loading failures - Images, animations, or content files missing


SUMMARY
=======
This comprehensive list covers 84+ distinct user scenarios that the app needs to handle gracefully, ranging from everyday usage patterns to extreme technical edge cases.

The app architecture shows good preparation for most of these cases through:
- Robust session management and daily reset logic
- Comprehensive error handling and validation systems
- Debug panel for testing edge cases
- Graceful fallbacks for missing or corrupted data
- Sequence-based conversation system with cross-navigation
- Semantic content system with multi-level fallbacks
