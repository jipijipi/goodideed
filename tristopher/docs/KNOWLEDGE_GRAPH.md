## Development Impact Analysis

When modifying components, consider these high-impact relationships:

### 🔴 **Critical Dependencies**
Changes to these affect many other components:
- **Conversation Engine**: Affects chat bubbles, robot character, debug panel
- **User Management System**: Impacts models, Firebase sync, achievements
- **Environment Configuration**: Affects Firebase, payments, development tools

### 🟡 **Moderate Dependencies**  
Changes require coordination with related components:
- **Core Models**: Affects conversation engine, user management, daily logging
- **Firebase Integration**: Impacts user management, environment config, payments
- **Enhanced Chat Bubble**: Affects main chat screen, conversation display

### 🟢 **Low Dependencies**
Changes are generally isolated:
- **Paper Background Design**: Mainly affects UI appearance
- **Asset Management**: Primarily resource organization
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Development workflow only

## Component Interaction Patterns

### 📱 **User Interface Pattern**
```

## Quick Reference

### Finding Components
- **UI Components**: Look in `screens/` and `widgets/` directories
- **Business Logic**: Check `services/` and `models/` directories  
- **Configuration**: See `config/` directory and environment files
- **State Management**: Find in `providers/` directory
- **Database**: Located in `utils/database/` directory

### Key Files
- `lib/main.dart` - Production entry point
- `lib/config/environment.dart` - Environment configuration
- `lib/providers/providers.dart` - State management setup
- `Makefile` - Development commands
- `pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies and project metadata

This knowledge graph serves as a living document that should evolve with the project. Regular updates ensure it remains an accurate representation of the Tristopher app architecture and relationships.
